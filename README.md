# Predicting Reservoir Hosts and Arthropod Vectors from Evolutionary Signatures in RNA Virus Genomes

_Simon A. Babayan, Richard J. Orton and Daniel G. Streicker_

## Background
A series of scripts and datasets described in Babayan et al. (in revision) which predict the reservoir hosts, existence of arthropod vectors and identity of arthropod vectors using gradient boosting machines implemented through h2o using R.

## File descriptions
blah.R, blah.R and blah.R do the machine learning parts
