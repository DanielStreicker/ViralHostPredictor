# Predicting Reservoir Hosts and Arthropod Vectors from Evolutionary Signatures in RNA Virus Genomes

_Simon A. Babayan, Richard J. Orton and Daniel G. Streicker_

## Background
A series of scripts and datasets described in Babayan et al. (in revision) which predict the reservoir hosts, existence of arthropod vectors and identity of arthropod vectors using gradient boosting machines implemented through h2o using R.

## File descriptions
## Datasets:
_BabayanEtAl_sequences.fasta_ contains coding sequences for all viruses used in the analyses


_EbolaTimeSeriesData.csv_ contains epidemiological data and genomic features for Zaire ebolaviruses sampled during the 2014-2016 West African outbreak

_BabayanEtAl_VirusData.csv_ contains reservoir host, arthropod-borne transmission status and vector taxa for all ssRNA viruses analyzed and genomic features extracted from the genome of each virus
